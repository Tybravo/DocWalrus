# GIT - Supreme's way of semantic versioning

Here are some of the GIT hacks everyone should know of:

## 1. GitLens

GitLens is a VSCode extension. It has been a lifesaver for me and my team. It works beautifully with VS Code. I can compare commits, and code from different branches, and check the history of each line of code. An epic tool to add to your code.

## 2. Moving or Migrating stashes from old computer to new:

First, List all your stashes:

```bash
git stash list
```

Stashes Export to Patch files. You'll have to specify your stash ID and provide a name for your patch file this for all the stashes you want to move:

```bash
git stash show -p stash@{0} > patch-file-name-0
git stash show -p stash@{1} > patch-file-name-1
```

Patch files will be created in the current directory. Copy the patch files into the new directory on the new machine.

Finally, Apply your stashes and finally Re-Stash them:

```bash
git apply patch-file-name-0
git stash
```

## 3. Delete branch on local and remote

To delete branch on local:
```bash
git branch -d local-branch-name
```

To push branch deletion to remote:
```bash
git push origin -d branch-name
```

## 4. Stage all files and commit in one line

```bash
git commit -am "Add all and commit"
```

## 5. Take a fresh pull of an existing branch without resolving merge conflicts

Need to delete your local branch and re-fetch it cleanly from the remote:

### Warning!
All local changes in that branch. Make sure to back up anything you need to keep.

5 Steps to Take Fresh Pull of an Existing Branch:

1. Switch to another branch (like main or master)
```bash
git checkout main
```

2. Delete the local branch (force delete, since it has conflicts)
```bash
git branch -D your-branch-name
```

3. Fetch the latest branches from remote
```bash
git fetch origin
```

4. Checkout the branch freshly from remote
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/your-branch-name
```
